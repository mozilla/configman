        d.a = 23
        d.dd = DotDictWithAcquisition()
        assert d.dd.a == 23

    Nested instances of DotDictWithAcquisition, when faced with a key not
    within the local mapping, will defer to the parent DotDict to find a key.
    Only if the key is not found in the root of the nested mappings will the
    KeyError be raised.  This is similar to the "acquisition" system found in
    Zope.

        d = DotDictWithAcquisition()
        d.dd = DotDictWithAcquisition()
        try:
            d.dd.x
        except KeyError:
            print "'x' was not found in d.dd or in d"

    When used with keys of the form 'x.y.z', acquisition can allow it to return
    acquired values even if the intermediate keys don't exist:

        d = DotDictWithAcquisition()
        d.a = 39
        assert d['x.y.z.a'] == 39

    Interestingly, indexing each component individually will result in a
    KeyError:

        d = DotDictWithAcquisition()
        d.a = 39
        try:
            print d.x.y.z.a
        except KeyError, e:
            assert str(e) == 'x'

    This behavior seems inconsistent, but really works so by design.  The form
    d.x.y.z.a is really equivalent to:

        t0 = d.x
        t1 = t0.y
        t2 = t1.z
        result = t2.a

    When broken out into separate operations, we want key errors to happen.
    Contrarily, the form d['x.y.z.a'] is a single lookup operation that reveals
    that our goal is to get a value for 'a'.  Since this class has acquisition,
    and 'a' is defined in the base, it is perfectly allowable.
