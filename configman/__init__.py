#
#    from configman import Namespace, ConfigurationManager
#

from configman.config_manager import ConfigurationManager

# this next line brings in command_line and, if argparse is available,
# a definition of the configman version of ArgumentParser.  Why is it done
# with "import *" ? Because I don't know what symbols to import, the decision
# about what is symbols exist within the module.  To make the import specific
# here, it would be necessary to reproduce the same logic that is already
# in the commandline module.
